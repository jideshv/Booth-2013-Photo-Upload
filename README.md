This is a modified version of https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload that I used to collect pictures and videos for the Chicago Booth 2013 EMBA Students.  Please see the original project if you want a good place to start with using the jQuery file uploader.

I used the php version of the server code on AWS Linux servers.  I setup the files directory to sync to dropbox so all the folks working on our yearbook can access photos as they are uploaded.
